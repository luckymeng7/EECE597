\chapter{Abstract}

Autonomous aerial vehicles are broadly used to assist human in dangerous or complex monitoring tasks, such as inspection of hard to reach high voltage power lines and oil pipes, monitoring and distinguishing wildfire, or improving precision farming. An autonomous navigation system can support the drones or robots to move towards the goal without any external control. A fully functional autonomous system requires an integration on a wide range of algorithms, including trajectory planning algorithms, object detection with image processing and robust control algorithms for path following. 

In this project, implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of trajectory planning Rapid-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm with object detected from the depth information collected from Intel Real Sense camera has been described. The location and size of the targets would be determined with image processing. And the trajectory planning algorithm RRT will plan the path in real time that ensure the safety of reaching the desired target domain.
