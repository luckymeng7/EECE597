# Conclusions

The trajectory planning algorithm implemented in this project is capable to detect the obstacles from a depth camera and generate a pathway to avoid the collision to the detected obstacles. RRT algorithm has been integrated for pathway planning with the obstacle detection implemented based on image processing with the video captured by RealSense camera. In the future, control algorithm for path following and object detection in real-time with RealSense SDK application with improved pathway planning and obstacle classification algorithms should be implemented.
